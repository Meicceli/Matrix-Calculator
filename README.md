# Matrix-Calculator

## Summary
Basic matrix calculator. Supports these basic operations: addition/substraction, multiplication, finding the determinant.

## How to run
- Download the repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/Meicceli/Matrix-Calculator.git`
- Run the program using python3: `python3 /path/to/Matrix-Calculator.git`

That's it! The program *should* also work with python2, but I strongly recommend using python3.
