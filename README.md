# Matrix-Calculator

## Summary
Basic matrix calculator with a 100% accuracy in calculations. Supports these basic operations:
- addition
- substraction
- multiplication
- scalar multiplication
- transposing
- finding the determinant
- finding the inverse.

## How to run
- Download the repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/Meicceli/Matrix-Calculator.git`
- Run the program using python3: `python3 /path/to/Matrix-Calculator/`
- The program will now guide you through your computations.

The program accepts floats and fractions as input. For example, the following are accepted inputs:
- `1/3`
- `12,14`
- `105.6/3.2`

The program works also with Python 2, but I strongly recommend using Python 3.
